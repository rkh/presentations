* "In computer programming, homoiconicity is a property of some programming
  languages, in which the primary representation of programs is also a data
  structure in a primitive type of the language itself, from the Greek words
  homo meaning the same and icon meaning representation. This makes
  metaprogramming easier than in a language without this property."
